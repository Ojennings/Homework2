	1. What makes SQL a nonprocedural language?
SQL is a language that tells things what should be done and not procedurally how things 
should be done. There are no loops and conditional statements that are in most procedural
languages.

	2.  How can you tell whether a database is truly relational?
A relational database presents the information in tables of rows and columns.
a table is what is referred to as a relation, in that it has a collection of objects
of the same type in the rows. A relational table would follow rules to maintain integrity 
all rows in the table are distinct, duplicate rows cause problems when searching and 
solving problems.

	3.  What can you do with SQL?
SQL is used as a front end to databases usually talks to a database server.  This can be 
used from the command line, this interfaces with many different programming languages for 
database management. Search, modify, create database and database elements.

	4. Name the process that separates data into distinct, unique sets.
Normalization reduces complexity of the structure of the previous level and reduces the 
amount of repetition

	5.  Do the following statements return the same or different output:

SELECT * FROM ARRESTS; select * from arrests;
	No SQL is case-insensitive, however just need to be aware of the capitalization when 
dealing with data

	6. None of the following queries work. Why not?

select *;   //the From clause is missing it is  mandatory component of a select statement
Select * from checks // the semicolon ";" that identifies the end of a statement
 Select amount name payee FROM checks;//  a comma is needed between each column 
 //select amount, name, payee FROM checks;

Which of the following SQL statements will work?

select * from checks; 
select * from checks; 
select * from checks 
	All three of these sql statements work



Do the following:

   	1. Write a query to return just the check officerId and the topCharge.
   			SELECT officerID,  topCharge FROM officerID;

	2. Rewrite the query from exercise 1 so that the topCharge will appear as the first column in your query results.
		SELECT topCharge, topCharge FROM officerID;

    3. Using the arrests table, write a query to return all the unique topCharges.
    	SELECT DISTINCT topCharges FROM arrests;
    	
    	
    	

    1. Write a query that returns everyone in the database whose last name begins with M.
    	SELECT * FROM doubleAgents where LASTNAME like'M%';
    2. Write a query that returns everyone who lives in Illinois with a first name of AL.
    	SELECT * FROM doubleAgents
    	WHERE STATE = 'IL'
    	AND FIRSTNAME = 'AL';
    	
    3. What shorthand could you use instead of WHERE a >= 10 AND a <=30?
    	WHERE a BETWEEN 10 and 30;

    4.  What will this query return?

    SELECT FIRSTNAME 
    FROM DOUBLE_AGENTS 
    WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'AL' 
    AND LASTNAME = 'BULHER';
	
		Nothing no such element in the table that meets these conditions.
		
	5.Using the DOUBLEAGENTS table, write a query that returns the following:
	 SELECT (FIRSTNAME || 'FROM') NAME, STATE
	FROM FRIENDS
	WHERE STATE = 'IL'
	AND
	LASTNAME = 'BUNDY'
	
	1.  Using the DOUBLEAGENTS table, write a query that returns the following:
				 SELECT LASTNAME ||  ',' || FIRSTNAME NAME, 
				AREA CODE || '-' || PHONE PHONE
				FROM DOUBLEAGENTS
				WHERE AREACODE BETWEEN 300 AND 350;
				
				
	
   	1.  Which function capitalizes the first letter of a character string and makes the 
   		rest lowercase?
		INITCAP
   	
    2.  Which functions are also known by the same name?
    	aggregate and group functions are the same thing

    3.  Will this query work?

      SELECT COUNT(LASTNAME) FROM CHARACTERS;
	Yes however it will only return the total of rows 

    4.  How about this one?

      SELECT SUM(LASTNAME) FROM CHARACTERS
      No, LASTNAME is a character field.

    5.  Assuming that they are separate columns, which function(s) would splice together
     FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME?
    '||' symbol
    
    6.  What does the answer 37 mean from the following SELECT?

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drone_strikes;
      the number of records in the table drone_strikes

    7.   Will the following statement work? (Hint: look up substr)

	 SELECT SUBSTR LASTNAME,1,5 FROM NAME_TBL;
	 
	 looks like i should make a table like
	  SELECT SUBSTR (LASTNAME, 1,5) NAME FROM NAME_TBL;
	 
	 
	 

    1.  Using a table called SHOOTSTATS table, write a query to determine who is are on 
    target less than .25.
		SELECT NAME FROM SHOOTSTATS
		WHERE (HITS/AB) < .25;

    2.  Using today's OFFICERS table, write a query that will return the following:
    SELECT 	substr (FIRST, 1, 1) || '_' ||
    		substr (MIDDLE, 1, 1) ||'_' ||
    		substr (LAST, 1,1) ||'_' || INITIALS, CODE
    		FROM OFFICERS
    		WHERE CODE = 32
    		
    		



    1.  Which clause works just like LIKE(%)? (HINT: Look it up on google.)
   			STARTING WITH

    2.  What is the function of the GROUP BY clause, and what other clause does it act like?
   		The GROUP BY clause groups data result sets that have been manipulated by various
   		 functions.  the group by clause acts like the order ORDER BY clause in that it 
   		 orders the results	of the query in the order of the columns are listed in the GROUP BY

  	3.  Will this SELECT work?

     NAME, AVG(SALARY), 
     DEPARTMENT FROM PAY_TBL WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'SWAT' 
     ORDER BY NAME 
     GROUP BY DEPARTMENT, SALARY;
     
     No. GROUP BY Should be stated before ORDER BY.

    4.  When using the HAVING clause, do you always have to use a GROUP BY also?
   	Yes

    5.  Can you use ORDER BY on a column that is not one of the columns in the SELECT 
   statement?
   	yes a select statement is not needed on a column that has an order by 

    6.  Using the ORGCHART table from the following examples, find out how many people on 
   each team have 30 or more days of sick leave.
